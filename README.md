Kwola
=====

Kwola is an AI user that helps you find bugs in your software. Unlike conventional testing solutions 
like Selenium or Cypress, Kwola will learn to use your user-interface completely automatically, with no 
configuration. Kwola does not require you to spend tedious effort writing testing code or manually
clicking through your app to double check it. Unleash Kwola on your URL and Kwola will be finding bugs in 
no time. In addition, Kwola provides you a video showing how to reproduce the bug and gives you 
the appropriate error messages & stack traces so you can track down the bug in the codebase.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

1) Python

Please go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python. You should also install the Python 
development headers, as some of our Python dependencies compile C / C++ code into Python modules.

At this time, Kwola requries Python version 3.7 or higher. If you run into issues, make sure are using the latest python version.

** IMPORTANT ** If you are installing on Windows, there are several errors that can occur if you either have multiple versions of Python installed, or have the 32 bit version of Python installed. Ensure that you have only a single, 64 bit version of Python installed or Torch, the neural network library, will have errors. In some instances, we have had to take the following steps with Python to get Kwola to work on Windows:
- fully uninstall all versions of Python
- find all folders called "python" in C:/ and delete them
- find anything python related in the AppData folder of the user (such as 'pip' and "Programs\Python") and delete them
- reinstall a fresh copy of the latest version of python, and specifically grab the 64bit only binary from the "Additional Downloads" section of the python website. When installing, use the "Custom" install, make sure pip is selected and that you want to install Python for all users.

2) NodeJS

Please go to https://nodejs.org/en/ to install NodeJS or install it through a package manager
appropriate for your distribution.

3) Chromium / Google Chrome

Please go to https://www.chromium.org/ to install Chromium (the open source version of Chrome), or 
go to https://chrome.google.com to install Google Chrome (you may have it installed already).

4) Chromedriver

Install chromedriver globally to your operating system. Go here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started
and install the binary appropriate for your operating system and which Chrome version you have installed.

On Windows, they don't give you a proper installer. Its just a zip file containing a prebuilt executable.
You need to put this executable in a folder thats on thr $PATH environment variable. So I usually just
copy and paste the executable into the C:\Windows folder. 

On macOS, this article provides great installation instructions: https://www.kenst.com/2015/03/installing-chromedriver-on-mac-osx/. I've resigned to just installing it through Homebrew.

For example, I run the following on Linux with Chrome 80:

`[user@localhost]$ wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/80.0.3987.106/chromedriver_linux64.zip`

`[user@localhost]$ unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip`

`[user@localhost]$ sudo cp chromedriver /usr/bin/`

Alternatively you can also install chromedriver just to your Python virtual environment.

5) Ffmpeg

You must install ffmpeg as it is used to compress the videos of Kwola interacting with the client program.

Please go to this url: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html to get instructions on how to install ffmpeg.

On macOS, if you have Homebrew installed (https://brew.sh/) then you can install Ffmpeg easily with:

`[user@localhost]$ brew install ffmpeg`

6) [linux / macOS] C & C++ Compiler

You need to install a c++ compiler, as it is used by some of the Python dependencies to compile highly 
efficient code.

On Ubuntu, you can run:

`[user@localhost]$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`

On Fedora, you can run:

`[user@localhost]$ sudo dnf install gcc-c++`

On macOS, you must install XCode or the XCode Command Line Build Tools get a compiler.

7) [windows] Visual Studio

Install visual studio community edition (or basically any version of visual studio) if you are using Windows.

Visual Studio is needed for the C++ compiler, used by some of our Python dependencies.
Go here for the download instructions: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

8) [optional] Nvidia Drivers & Cuda

How you install NVIDIA Drivers depends on your operating system. You only need to install NVIDIA drivers if you 
are using GPUs. Using GPUs is recommended but optional, and you can do test runs with just the CPU.

Windows: Go here for instructions: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

MacOS: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/index.html

Ubuntu: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-the-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux
* Its recommended to stick to LTS releases for Ubuntu when doing high performance computing.

Fedora: https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2015/fedora-nvidia-guide/

9) [optional] Docker

Go here and follow the instructions to install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Docker not required for Kwola to operate but is used in some of the examples.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Create a virtual environment. Doing this is not 100% necessary, you can install Kwola globally,
but there is a much higher likelihood of a package version conflict. Installing inside the virtual
environment is the most reliable way to run Kwola. Run the following commands in your terminal on Linux / macOS or
in PowerShell on Windows.

`[user@localhost]$ python3 -m venv venv`

`[user@localhost]$ source venv/bin/activate`

Install Kwola using pip.

`[user@localhost]$ pip3 install kwola --upgrade --no-cache`

Install babel-cli and the Kwola babel plugin globally. This makes it easier for the code to access the babel binary.

`[user@localhost]$ sudo npm install @babel/cli -g`

`[user@localhost]$ sudo npm install @babel/core -g`

`[user@localhost]$ sudo npm install babel-plugin-kwola -g`

Some users have been running into issues when they install the babel-plugin-kwola globally. Therefore, just run
it a second time without -g to install it in your local directory for safe meaasure.

`[user@localhost]$ npm install babel-plugin-kwola`

We are still sorting out precisely what the cause of the issue is.

That's it! Kwola should now be installed.

Usage
=====

Running Kwola is very straightforward. First activate your virtual environment:

`[user@localhost]$ source venv/bin/activate`

To initiate a Kwola testing session, run the following command. Make sure to replace the URL with the url pointing 
to the website you want to start testing. The URL must be a complete, fully validated url containing 
the http:// part and everything.

`[user@localhost]$ kwola http://demo.kwolatesting.com/`

Kwola will now start testing your application! Its that easy. Kwola will create a directory to hold
all of its results in your current directory. You can cancel the run simply using Ctrl-C or Cmd-C in
your terminal. If you want to restart the run, simply run kwola with no arguments:

`[user@localhost]$ kwola`

Or alternatively, you can run Kwola and give it a specific directory containing a Kwola run. This
allows you to restart specific runs.

`[user@localhost]$ kwola kwola_run_1`

If you want to just quickly test Kwola, use our live restaurant testing demo, available at
http://demo.kwolatesting.com/ You may want to visit it in your browser first to warm up the server
its running on before running the console command.

You can use Kwola with any of our example codebases if you have Docker installed:

`[user@localhost]$ docker run docker.io/kwola/kros-1`

`[user@localhost]$ kwola http://172.17.0.2:3000/`

You will then see Kwola running on our restaraunt backend sample codebase.
